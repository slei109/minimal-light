## About Me

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science of Virginia Tech. My research focuses on few-shot learning
  and robust model learning. I'm currently open for opportunities in research facilities.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning

## News

- **[Jul. 2022]** Our paper about cross-domain few-shot semantic segmentation is accepted by ECCV 2022.
- **[May. 2022]** OUr paper about NLP is accepted by NACCL 2022.
- **[Oct. 2021]** Our paper about few-shot learning is published on TKDD 2021.
- **[Jul. 2021]** Our paper about few-shot semantic segmentation is accepted by ICME 2021.
